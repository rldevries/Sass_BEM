Special Thanks:
This repo is composed of segments relating to Jessica Chan's Youtube Video titled: Sass and BEM for beginners.

In order to have a better understanding, I merely documented the individual parts into corresponding Chapters in the attached word doc. This also includes illustrations on what/where/how the individual components or partials are created for future reference.

I take no credit in her means of delivery, I only wanted something that can be searched for in an easier way.

This learning experience was truly informative and 'eye-opening' into the world of Sass and BEM.

Thanks go out to her for all the effort in helping the community achieve a better understanding of HTML, CSS including SCSS (Sass).
