# Special Thanks:

This repo is composed of Parts: 1 - Parts: 4, relating to :star: Jessica Chan's Youtube Video titled: [Sass and BEM for beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfMHA8SqUL4).

In order to have a better understanding, I merely documented ‚úçÔ∏è the individual parts into corresponding Chapters in the attached üìò. This also includes illustrations on what/where/how the individual components or partials are created for future reference.

I take no credit in her means of delivery, I only wanted something that can be :mag_right: searched for in an easier way.

This learning experience was truly informative and 'eye-opening' into the world of Sass and BEM.

Thanks go out to her for all the effort in helping the community achieve a better understanding of HTML, CSS and SCSS (Sass).
